## Getting Started

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Launches the app in development mode. Access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will pop up in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Kickstart the test runner in interactive watch mode. üß™üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include cryptographic hashes for security.

For deployment details, check out the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you seek total control over build configurations, execute the `eject` command. Beware, it's the point of no return! üò±üõ†Ô∏è
